Seen originally in "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire", Reducio basically means 'to reduce/shrink'. Reducio is a shrinking charm, resulting in the reduction of target's shape as soon as it is cast.

It makes things smaller, as does the 'tar' command in linux, since it compresses or shrinks files :P

Usage: $ reducio /path/to/source1 /path/to/source2 ... /path/to/source-N /path/to/destination

Cheers!
